myBlaze, downloaded from OpenCores.org
======================================

MyBlaze is a synthesizable clone of the MicroBlaze Soft Processor written in
MyHDL (http://www.myhdl.org). It started as a translation of MB-Lite from
VHDL to MyHDL, along with a simple emulator. Its minimal configuration was
tested on the Spartan-3E Starter Kit.
